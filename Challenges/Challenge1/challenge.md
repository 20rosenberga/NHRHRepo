Challenge 1

Pretend that you want to get to know a track star a little better.

Write a program that asks the user for their First and Second initials, their best mile time in minutes with decimal form (e.g. 6.5 minutes), their age, if they will compete in the next competition (they answer 1 or 0), and how many teammates they have.  

Output all of this information to the console in a nice format.
