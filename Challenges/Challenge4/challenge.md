Let's enhance our cashier program.

Write a new cashier program that allows the user to choose what they buy.  

The user should start with $30 in their wallet and have the choice of buying:

    Gum             -   $1.99
    Book            -   $7.99
    CD              -   $10.99
    Video Game      -   $22.99
    Roller Blades   -   $29.99
    Blue-Eyes White Dragon - $9999.99

The user should only be able to choose a single item from the list.  If the item exceeds the balance of their wallet, then they cannot buy it.  

Make sure you print the user's remaining money to the screen afterwards.

Good luck!
